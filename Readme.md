All functions are in the main.py file.
Two ways to use this application:
1. **Run Directly:** Download and double-click the `main.exe` file.
2. **Build from Source:** If you prefer to build from source, you can use the `main.py` file to create your own executable.
   - Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Build the executable: `pyinstaller --onefile main.py`
   - Find the `main.exe` file in the `dist` folder.
   - Run the application: `./dist/main.exe`
